# MAGIC **Exploratory & Analytical Challenges**
# MAGIC 1. Ticket Volume Trend Detection
# MAGIC Identify sudden spikes or drops in ticket volume over time using statistical thresholds or moving averages.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. Resolution Time Distribution Analysis
# MAGIC Create a histogram-like summary of resolution times bucketed into intervals (e.g., 0–2 hrs, 2–6 hrs, etc.).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest
# MAGIC Use Isolation Forest (via PySpark MLlib) to detect outlier tickets based on resolution time, priority, and SLA breach.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Logic & Transformation Challenges**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 4. Dynamic SLA Breach Classification
# MAGIC Create a logic that adjusts SLA breach thresholds based on ticket priority and business hours.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 5. Custom Time Zone Conversion
# MAGIC Convert all timestamps to a user-defined time zone using a UDF, accounting for daylight saving changes.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 6. Ticket Reassignment Chain
# MAGIC Track how many times a ticket was reassigned before resolution using event logs or status changes.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Resolution Time Prediction Model**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 7. Build a regression model to predict resolution time based on ticket metadata (priority, assignment group, etc.).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 8. Text Feature Extraction
# MAGIC Extract keywords or sentiment from ticket descriptions using PySpark NLP and use them as features.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 9. Cluster Stability Check
# MAGIC Run KMeans clustering multiple times and compare cluster consistency using silhouette scores.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Engineering & Optimization**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 10. Incremental Data Load Simulation
# MAGIC Simulate an incremental load where only new or updated tickets are processed daily using watermarking logic.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 11. Broadcast Join Optimization
# MAGIC Identify scenarios where broadcast joins improve performance and implement them with hints.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 12. Skew Join Mitigation with Salting
# MAGIC Implement salting to handle skewed joins between ticket data and a large user table.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Visualization & Reporting**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 13. Weekly Heatmap of Ticket Volume
# MAGIC Create a matrix showing ticket volume by day of week and hour of day.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 14. Assignment Group Performance Dashboard
# MAGIC Generate summary metrics (avg resolution time, SLA breach rate, ticket count) per group for dashboarding.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Creative Simulation**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 15. Synthetic Ticket Generator
# MAGIC Write a PySpark job that generates synthetic ticket data with realistic distributions for testing purposes.
