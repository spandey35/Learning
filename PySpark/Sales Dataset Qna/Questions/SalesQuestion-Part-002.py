# MAGIC ## **Intermediate Level**
# MAGIC 1. **Filter & Select**: Retrieve all transactions where the `total_amount` is greater than 500 and `payment_type` is "Credit Card".
# MAGIC 2. **Aggregation**: Find the total `total_amount` spent by each customer.
# MAGIC 3. **Sorting**: Get the top 10 customers who have spent the most, sorted in descending order.
# MAGIC 4. **Join**: Join `transactions` with `customers` to get the customer name along with transaction details.
# MAGIC 5. **Date Filtering**: Get all transactions from the last 3 months.
# MAGIC 6. **Group & Count**: Count the number of transactions for each `product_category`.

# MAGIC 7. **Multi-Join**: Join `transactions`, `customers`, and `products` to create a master dataset with customer, product, and transaction details.
# MAGIC 8. **Window Functions**: For each customer, rank their purchases by `total_amount` (highest first).
# MAGIC 9. **Aggregated Metrics**: For each product category, calculate the total sales amount, average price, and number of unique customers who purchased it.
# MAGIC 10. **Top-N by Group**: Find the top 3 most expensive products purchased by each customer.
# MAGIC 11. **Monthly Trends**: For each month, find the total sales and number of transactions.
# MAGIC 12. **Conditional Aggregation**: Calculate the total amount spent by each customer, separating totals for "Online" vs "Offline" orders.
